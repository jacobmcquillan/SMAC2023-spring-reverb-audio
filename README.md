"Helical Spring Mode Grouping" add link when published

All audio clips employ a simple loss mechanism imposing a quadratic dependency on wave number.

File labels "a"-"g" correspond to the same labels in Figure 7, showing the (lossless) impulse responses of separate mode groups.

Impulse responses are provided for the full modal engine and each of the 6 groups. Where the effect has been applied to guitar/drums, only the full response, one set of isolated upper chirps, and one set of the isolated lower chirps are provided. Various mixes of the wet and dry signals are provided.
