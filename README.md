"Helical Spring Mode Grouping" add link when published

modelled impulse responses of grouped modes and audio examples applying the effect to a guitar riff.

File label "bending" corresponds to exciting and picking-up one of the bending polarisations (v) - as in Figure 6, and "twisting" to the torsional polarisation (theta_w) - not shown in the paper.

File labels "a"-"g" correspond to the same labels in Figure 6, showing the impulse responses of separate mode groups.

Impulse responses are provided for the full modal engine and each of the 6 groups. Where the effect has been applied to a guitar signal, only the full response, one set of isolated upper chirps, and one set of the isolated lower chirps are provided. Various levels of wet/dry are provided.
