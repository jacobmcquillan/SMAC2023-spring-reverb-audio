"Helical Spring Mode Grouping" add link when published

modelled impulse responses of grouped modes and audio examples applying the effect to a guitar riff.

Files labelled bending correspond to exciting and picking-up one of the bending polarisations (v), and twisting to the torsional polarisation (theta_w).

Files labelled a-g correspond to the same labels in Figure 6, showing the impulse response for separate mode groups.

All 6 groups and the full response are uploaded for the impulse responses. Where guitar riffs have been used to show the effect, only the full response, isolated upper chirps, and one set of the isolated lower chirps are provided. Various levels of wet/dry are provided.
